# OMIIasi

## Description
OMIIasi is a comprehensive platform designed to help students solve programming problems from previous editions of the Computer Science Olympiad with ease. As a former computer science Olympiad student in high school, I was inspired by my teacher to create this project to address the challenges faced by both students and teachers due to the lack of such a platform.
